# Next.js `<a>` vs `<Link>`

A simple web page to demonstrate the apparent differences between `<a>` tags and next.js `<Link>` components.

Setup project locally by cloning repo and running

`npm run dev`

Then navigate to [http://localhost:3000/]

The first download link uses `<a>` tags.
This download the wave image to local storage.


The second download link uses `<Link>`.
This navigates to the wave image instead of downloading it.

Try them both out to see difference in behaviours.
